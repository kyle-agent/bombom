# Session Start

## Dominant Variable
Does the handoff contain **what to do next**, or **a list of what was done**? If it's a completion log, it was written wrong. If you can't identify Priority 1 immediately, go deeper in Phase 1.

## Discard If
- `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md` missing (first session) → skip, start fresh
- User says "start fresh" / "ignore context" → skip
- Quick one-off question unrelated to ongoing work → skip

> **Auto-trigger signal**: If ≥5,000 tokens accumulated AND ≥3 tool calls AND ≥24h since last session — high-value context is at risk. Run this skill before starting new work (Triple Gate pattern).

> **Phase 0.5 always runs** — environment warnings apply regardless of Discard. A misconfigured model ID or an oversized allow-entry list is worth surfacing even in a one-off session.

---

## Phase 0.5: Environment Health Check

> Warning-only — never blocks session start. Read-only (no modifications).

**Check 1 — Model ID** (read `~/.claude/settings.json`):
- Verify the `"model"` field matches a known Claude Code model identifier.
  Known valid values: `"opus"`, `"sonnet"`, `"haiku"`, `"claude-opus-4-7"`, `"claude-sonnet-4-6"`, `"claude-haiku-4-5"`, `"claude-opus-4-5"`, `"claude-sonnet-4-5"`
- Unrecognized value → `⚠️ settings.json model ID unrecognized: "{value}" — update recommended`
- File missing → skip silently.

**Check 2 — Allow entry accumulation** (read `~/.claude/settings.local.json`):
- Count entries in the `permissions.allow` array.
- If count > 5 → `⚠️ settings.local.json: N allow entries accumulated — review and clean up`

  Background: each session-scoped permission approval appends an entry here. Accumulated entries represent past one-time approvals that silently persist, widening the permission surface over time. More than 5 is a signal to audit and prune.
- File missing → skip silently.

**Output rule**: both checks clean → **no output** (omit Environment alert from Phase 5). Any warning → surface in Phase 5 under `**Environment alert:**`.

---

## Phase 1: Load Handoff

Read `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md` (auto-loaded above).

Extract:
- **Priority 1** — the most urgent next action for this session
- **Open decisions** — questions awaiting user input
- **Remaining issues** — unresolved bugs or blockers
- **Context notes** — failed approaches to avoid repeating, key causation discovered last session

If the file is empty or missing: output `[no handoff found — starting fresh]` and exit.

---

## Phase 2: Review Lessons

Read `tasks/lessons.md`.

Scan for rules relevant to today's priorities:
- Code changes planned → look for correction rules about patterns in that area
- About to commit or push → check commit-related rules
- Debugging → check any debugging anti-patterns recorded

**v2 metadata utilization** (optional enhancement — if lessons.md includes confidence/last-seen/observation metadata):
- `conf ≥ 0.7` (verified/core) → flag the **rule body in 1 line** as priority signal
- `conf 0.5` (moderate) → show **title only, 1 line**
- `conf < 0.5` (tentative/experimental) → **TOC header only** or skip (noise)
- `seen` within 30 days AND `obs ≥ 3` → active pattern, surface first
- Lessons without v2 metadata (legacy) → handle normally (backward compat)

Flag each applicable rule, one line each. Skip silently if file missing.

---

## Phase 3: Global State Check

If your project maintains a cross-project state file (e.g., `~/.claude/STATE.md`), read it for cross-project blockers and decisions.

Check:
- Any open decisions resolvable in this session?
- Any active blockers you can touch now?

Skip if the state file is missing or your project does not use one.

---

## Phase 4: Memory Quick-Check

### 4.1 Selective Load

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` with tag-based filtering:

- `<!-- #always -->` tagged sections → load in full (core information)
- `<!-- #on-demand -->` tagged sections → extract headers as TOC only (Grep when needed)
- Untagged MEMORY.md → load in full (backward compatible)

Steps:
1. `Grep "^##.*<!-- #always -->"` → Read those sections in full
2. `Grep "^##.*<!-- #on-demand -->"` → Collect header names only
3. Output TOC for on-demand sections in the ready signal:
   ```
   MEMORY.md (on-demand — Grep to access):
   - Section A
   - Section B
   ```

### 4.2 Spot-Check

1. **Stale references** — handoff names a file path or function → Glob/Grep one or two key items to confirm they still exist. If not, flag immediately.
2. **Overdue promotions** — any item in `memory/context-log.md` with `[ref:N]` where N ≥ 3 → promote to MEMORY.md now, before starting work.

This is a spot-check on 1-2 items. If it takes more than 60 seconds, you're scanning too many items.

Skip if MEMORY.md missing.

---

## Phase 5: Ready Signal

Output a structured briefing:

```
## Session Ready

**Priority 1:** [top item from handoff — specific, actionable]
**Priority 2:** [second item if present]

**Open decisions:** [list, or "none"]
**Active blockers:** [list, or "none"]

**Lessons flagged:** [applicable rules from Phase 2, or "none"]
**Memory alerts:** [stale refs or promotions triggered, or "none"]
**Global:** [STATE.md items relevant to this session, or "none"]
**Environment alert:** [Phase 0.5 warnings — omit this line if clean]
```

Then: `Ready. What would you like to start with?`

---

## Scope Boundary

| Does | Does NOT |
|------|----------|
| [READ] Load and summarize handoff + lessons | Write code or modify files |
| [READ] Spot-check 1-2 stale memory references | Run full test suite or project scan |
| [READ] Flag applicable correction rules for today | Rewrite the handoff file |
| [EDIT] Promote overdue context-log entries to MEMORY.md | Make architecture or design decisions |

---

## Invariants (never violate)

1. **Read-only by default**: session-start loads context — it does not modify files. The one permitted exception: promoting a `[ref:N≥3]` entry to MEMORY.md (this is a stale-detection write, not a session write). No other writes.

2. **Missing file = silent skip, not error**: if `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/settings.local.json` is missing, skip that phase or check without error. Never block session start on a missing file.

3. **Ready signal must include Priority 1**: the output must name at least one concrete next action. "Session started" with no priority is a violation — it means the handoff has no actionable items, which is worth flagging to the user explicitly.

4. **Phase 0.5 always runs**: the environment health check applies even when the main skill is discarded. A misconfigured model ID or bloated allow list is worth surfacing on any session, including first sessions and one-off questions.

---

## Output

- **Conversation**: structured ready signal (priorities + open decisions + lessons flagged)
- **Files written**: none — or `memory/MEMORY.md` if an overdue promotion was triggered

---

## Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Counter |
|-----------------|---------|
| "The handoff looks empty, I'll just say 'ready'" | Invariant 3: must name Priority 1. If handoff is truly empty, say so — that itself is actionable information. |
| "I should update the handoff now that I've read it" | Invariant 1: session-start is read-only. Handoff updates happen at session end via `/session-checkpoint`. |
| "Phase 4 memory check feels slow, I'll skip it" | It is a spot-check on 1-2 items. If it's slow, you are scanning too many. Narrow the scope and run it. |
| "No handoff exists yet, but I'll generate one based on the codebase" | Discard condition: no handoff = start fresh. Do not synthesize a handoff — that would invent context that wasn't saved. |

---

## Pair

This skill is the opening half of the session lifecycle.
`/session-start` → work → `/session-checkpoint`

Install both or install neither — designed as a pair.

---

## Proven In

Multi-session development workflows across codebases of varying size. The handoff file becomes more valuable as project scope grows — the larger the codebase and the longer the session gap, the more critical this skill becomes for avoiding re-discovery of context.
